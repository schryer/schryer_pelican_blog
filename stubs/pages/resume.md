Summary: My resume

Programmer — Data analyst — Technical editor/writer

**Programmer with a chemical engineering background.** I seek a
position in a visionary company within a great team. Most people would
characterize me as an excellent communicator (founder of
[Scientific Scribe OÜ]) with an eye for detail who enjoys difficult
technical problems. I enjoy creating software and would like an
opportunity to work within a professional team.
